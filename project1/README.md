This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to make a game. It also uses a Sound Manager to provide a sound effect.  

The purpose of the game is to use the mouse to navigate a bug through a maze, clicking on link buttons along the way. It is a two player game which starts with the first player's turn. After the first player's turn it switches to the second player's turn. Each player has three points. A player will lose a point if the bug touches a rock, stone wall or the bird at the end of the maze. At the end of the second player's turn the game will alert which player has won by determining which player has the most points.

I started by creating four HTML elements to make a basic maze. From this I added more elements and experiemented with jQuery animations to create a more complex and interesting user game. I added JavaScript functions to provide game logic such as using player scores to determine a winner. I added CSS styles and background images to change the appearance of the game from simple shapes to interesting icons and imagery. 

It was very challenging to ensure the HTML elements laid out on the page without disrupting the design for the maze. It was also difficult defining a JavaScript function that resets the game once the first player's turn is over.

I am very pleased with the animation effects and being able to add a sound effect. I am also very happy with the appearance of the game. I have learned a lot about how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery and how they interact when working on a project. I have been able to be much more creative with my work as a result.'
